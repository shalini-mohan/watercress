 - [X] could you update how you write country of origin (i.e. "product of countryname" instead of abbreviated form)?
 - 
 - [X] And add price again in the comparison table as an attribute
 - [X] Oh and add dollar sign for prices
 - 
 - [-] And make the horizontal slide show view more evident
   - [X] like put the header "Related Products"
   - [ ] like maybe even make the portion of related products have a diff background colour?
     - [ ] and by a different colour for related products, maybe you could put save on foods green as the background
 - 
 - [ ] and could we add a cart icon next to "My Cart" ?
 - 
 - [ ] and make arrows evident in the Related Products section
   - [ ] so put one giant right scrolling arrow
   - [ ] and one left scrolling arrow (one arrow on each side of the horizontal slide show view)
